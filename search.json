Take, example, model five transition intensities two covariates. Specifying constraint = list (age = c(1,1,1,2,2), treatment = c(1,2,3,4,5)) constrains effect age equal first three intensities, equal fourth fifth. effect treatment assumed different intensity. vector increasing numbers can used indicators. intensity parameters assumed ordered reading across rows transition matrix, starting first row, ignoring diagonals.

Note possible specify exactly covariate effects constrained positive negative.  maximum likelihood estimation chooses combination signs higher likelihood. categorical covariates, defined factors, specify constraints follows: list(..., covnameVALUE1 = c(...), covnameVALUE2 = c(...), ...) covname name factor, VALUE1, VALUE2, ... labels factor levels (usually excluding baseline, using default contrasts). Make sure contrasts option set appropriately, example, default options(contrasts=c(contr.treatment, contr.poly)) sets first (baseline) level unordered factors zero, baseline level ignored specification. assume covariate effect certain transition, use fixedpars argument fix initial value (zero default) optimisation. misccovariates formula representing covariates misclassification probabilities, analogously covariates, via multinomial logistic regression. used model specified using ematrix, rather hmodel. must single formula - lists supported, unlike covariates.  different model probability required, include covariates formula, use fixedpars fix effects (particular probabilities) default initial values zero. misccovinits Initial values covariates misclassification probabilities, defined way covinits. used model specified using ematrix. miscconstraint list one vector named covariate misclassification probabilities. vector indicates covariate effects misclassification probabilities constrained equal, analogously constraint.  used model specified using ematrix. hcovariates List formulae length hmodel, defining covariates governing hidden Markov outcome models.  covariates operate suitably link-transformed linear scale, example, log scale Poisson outcome model. covariates certain hidden state, insert NULL corresponding place list.  example, hcovariates = list(~acute + age, ~acute, NULL). hcovinits Initial values hidden Markov model covariate effects. list length hcovariates. element vector initial values effect covariate state. example, hcovariates can initialised hcovariates = list(c(-8, 0), -8, NULL). Initial values must given covariates, none given set zero.  initial value given hmodel constructor function corresponding baseline parameter interpreted value parameter covariates fixed means data.  multiple effects constrained equal using hconstraint, initial value taken first multiple initial values supplied. hconstraint named list. element vector constraints named hidden Markov model parameter. vector length equal number times class parameter appears whole model. example consider three-state hidden Markov model described , normally-distributed outcomes states 1 2.  constrain outcome variance equal states 1 2, also constrain effect acute outcome mean equal states 1 2, specify hconstraint = list(sd = c(1,1), acute=c(1,1)) Note excludes initial state occupancy probabilities covariate effects probabilities, constrained. hranges Range constraints hidden Markov model parameters. Supplied named list, element corresponding named hidden Markov model parameter.  element list two elements, vectors named \"lower\" \"upper\".  vectors length equal number times class parameter appears whole model, give corresponding mininum amd maximum allowable values parameter.  Maximum likelihood estimation performed parameters constrained ranges (log logit-type transformation).  Lower bounds -Inf upper bounds Inf can given parameter unbounded . example, three-state model , constrain mean state 1 0 6, mean state 2 7 12, supply hranges=list(mean=list(lower=c(0, 7), upper=c(6, 12))) default natural ranges, e.g. positive real line variance parameters, [0,1] probabilities.  Therefore hranges need specified parameters unless even stricter constraint desired.  one limit supplied parameter, first occurrence parameter constrained. Initial values strictly within ranges, range boundary, otherwise optimisation fail \"non-finite value\" error. qconstraint vector indicators specifying baseline transition intensities equal. example, qconstraint = c(1,2,3,3) constrains third fourth intensities equal, model four allowed instantaneous transitions.  covariates intensities center=TRUE (default), qconstraint applied intensities covariates taking values means data.  center=FALSE, qconstraint applied intensities covariates set zero. econstraint similar vector indicators specifying baseline misclassification probabilities constrained equal.  used model specified using ematrix, rather hmodel. initprobs used hidden Markov models.

Structural zeroes allowed: initial values zero fixed zero optimisation, even est.initprobs=TRUE, covariate effects estimated.  exception state 1, non-zero occupancy probability. Note free parameters estimation exclude state 1 occupancy probability, fixed one minus sum probabilities. initcovariates Formula representing covariates initial state occupancy probabilities, via multinomial logistic regression.  linear effects covariates, observed individual's first observation time, operate log ratio state \\(r\\) occupancy probability state 1 occupancy probability, \\(r = 2\\) number states.  Thus state 1 occupancy probability non-zero. est.initprobs TRUE, effects estimated starting initial values.  est.initprobs FALSE, effects fixed theit initial values. initcovinits Initial values covariate effects initcovariates.  named list element corresponding covariate, covinits. element vector (1 - number states) elements, containing initial values linear effect covariate log odds state relative state 1, state 2 final state.  initcovinits specified, covariate effects initialised zero. deathexact Vector indices absorbing states whose time entry known exactly, individual assumed unknown transient state (\"alive\") previous instant.  usual situation times death chronic disease monitoring data.  example, specify deathexact = c(4, 5) states 4 5 assumed exactly-observed death states. See obstype argument.  States kind correspond obstype=3. deathexact = TRUE indicates final absorbing state kind, deathexact = FALSE deathexact = NULL (default) indicates state kind. deathexact argument overridden obstype exacttimes. Note always supply deathexact argument, even states correspond deaths, necessarily obstype=3.  state known time death previous observation, specify obstype=2 death times, exacttimes=TRUE state known times, deathexact argument ignored. death Old name deathexact argument.  Overridden deathexact supplied. Deprecated. exacttimes default, transitions Markov process assumed take place unknown occasions observation times. exacttimes set TRUE, observation times assumed represent exact times transition process.  subject assumed state times.  observation may represent transition different state repeated observation state (e.g. end follow-).  equivalent every row data obstype = 2.  See obstype argument.  obstype exacttimes specified exacttimes ignored. Note complete history multi-state process known type data.  models msm fits strong assumption constant (piecewise-constant) transition rates.  Knowing exact transition times allows realistic models fitted packages.  example parametric models sojourn distributions flexible exponential can fitted flexsurv package, semi-parametric models can implemented survival conjunction mstate. censor state, vector states, indicates censoring. Censoring means observed state known one particular set states. example, censor=999 indicates observations 999 vector observed states censored states.  default, means true state transient (non-absorbing) states. specify corresponding true states explicitly, use censor.states argument. Note contrast usual terminology survival analysis, state considered censored, rather event time.  end study, individual died, true state known, censor unnecessary, since standard multi-state model likelihood applicable.  Also \"censored\" state can time, just end. hidden Markov models, censoring may indicate either set possible observed states, set (hidden) true states. later case specified setting relevant elements obstrue 1 (NA otherwise). Note particular general time-inhomogeneous Markov models piecewise constant transition intensities can constructed using censor facility. true state unknown occasions piecewise constant covariate known change, censored states can inserted data occasions.  covariate may represent time , case pci option msm can used perform trick automatically, time-dependent variable. supported multivariate hidden Markov models specified hmmMV. censor.states Specifies underlying states censored observations can represent. censor single number (default) can vector, list one element.  censor vector one element, list, element vector corresponding equivalent element censor. example censor = c(99, 999), censor.states = list(c(2,3), c(3,4)) means observations coded 99 represent either state 2 state 3, observations coded 999 really either state 3 state 4. pci Model piecewise-constant intensities.  Vector cut points defining times, since start process, intensities change subjects.  example pci = c(5, 10) specifies intensity changes time points 5 10.  automatically construct model categorical (factor) covariate called timeperiod, levels \"[-Inf,5)\", \"[5,10)\" \"[10,Inf)\", first level baseline.  covariate defines time period observation made.  Initial values constraints covariate effects specified way model covariate name, example, covinits = list(\"timeperiod[5,10)\"=c(0.1,0.1), \"timeperiod[10,Inf)\"=c(0.1,0.1)) Thus pci supplied, previously-existing variable called timeperiod covariate part msm model. assume piecewise constant intensities transitions others pci, use fixedpars argument fix appropriate covariate effects default initial values zero. Internally, works inserting censored observations data times intensity changes state observed. supplied times outside range time variable data, pci ignored time-homogeneous model fitted. fitting time-inhomogeneous model, qmatrix.msm can used obtain fitted intensity matrices time period, example, qmatrix.msm(example.msm, covariates=list(timeperiod=\"[5,Inf)\")) facility support interactions time covariates.  models need specified \"hand\", using state variable censored observations inserted.  Note data component msm object returned call msm pci supplied contains states inserted censored observations time period indicators.  can used construct models. Note need use pci order model effect time-dependent covariate data.  msm automatically assume covariates piecewise-constant change times observed.  pci want intensities change pre-specified times subjects. pci supported multivariate hidden Markov models specified hmmMV.   approximate equivalent can constructed creating variable data represent time period, treating covariate using covariates argument msm. assume value variable constant observations. phase.states Indices states two-phase sojourn distribution.  defines semi-Markov model, hazard onward transition depends time spent state. uses technique described Titman Sharples (2009).  hidden Markov model automatically constructed expanded state space, phases correspond hidden states.  \"tau\" proportionality constraint described paper currently supported.
