# Multi-State Markov and Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time

msm: Functions for fitting continuous-time Markov and hidden Markov
multi-state models to longitudinal data. Designed for processes observed
at arbitrary times in continuous time (intermittently observed or panel
data) but some other observation schemes are supported. Both Markov
transition rates and the hidden Markov output process can be modelled in
terms of covariates, which may be constant or piecewise-constant in
time.
